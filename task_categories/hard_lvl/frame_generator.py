# TASK: Create a program that, given an array of strings and a character to be used as border, outputs the frame with the content inside.
"""
Rules:
    - Keep a space between the input string and the left and right borders
    - Let the user know what they need to input
    - Handle errors, prevent the program from crashing if an invalid input is entered
Example:
    text input -> HELLO WORLD
    border input -> #
    output ->
                ###############
                # HELLO WORLD #
                ###############
